# FNB App Academy Projects

A curated collection of projects developed during the **FNB App Academy** bootcamp. This repository showcases a journey through full-stack web development, featuring hands-on applications built with modern technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.

## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository is organized into multiple directories, each representing a distinct project or module from the academy. Below is a summary of the key projects included:

### **1. Capstone Project (`/capstone`)**
The culminating project of the academy, demonstrating proficiency in full-stack development. This is a fully-functional web application integrating a React frontend with a robust Node.js/Express backend and a PostgreSQL database.

### **2. Frontend Projects (`/frontend-projects`)**
A series of projects focused on building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
*   **React Applications:** Interactive single-page applications (SPAs) built using React, showcasing state management, component-based architecture, and API consumption.
*   **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Foundational projects highlighting core web development skills, DOM manipulation, and responsive design principles.

### **3. Backend Projects (`/backend-projects`)**
Projects centered around server-side logic, API design, and database management.
*   **Node.js & Express:** RESTful API servers handling HTTP requests, middleware, routing, and user authentication.
*   **PostgreSQL & SQL:** Database schemas, queries, and operations demonstrating data modeling and efficient data persistence.

### **4. Algorithm & Data Structure Challenges (`/algorithm-challenges`)**
A compilation of solved coding challenges focusing on problem-solving, algorithmic efficiency, and data structure implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
*   **Other Tools:** Various npm packages

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v14 or higher)
*   npm or yarn
*   PostgreSQL

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Neo21702/FNB-App-Academy-projects.git
    cd FNB-App-Academy-projects
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a specific project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd project-directory-name
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up the database:**
    *   Create a new PostgreSQL database.
    *   Configure your environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file) with your database connection string and other secrets.
    *   Run the database schema scripts (if provided).

5.  **Run the application:**
    *   For the backend (if applicable):
        ```bash
        npm run server
        ```
    *   For the frontend (if applicable):
        ```bash
        npm run client
        ```
    *   For full-stack projects with a `package.json` in the root, you might use:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
